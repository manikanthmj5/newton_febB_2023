HTML Bugs:
//HTML will not provide you bugs most of the time it will take care automatically.
//example if body tag or head tag or html tag or you forgot to close the tags it will not throw any errors and browser will get compiled those code as well
Compiler erros 
//You can check inside the inspect--->console

What is attributes?
//Extra information about the tags 
//key and value is predefined property in attribute
//example: align attribute to adjust the position of the tags 
//values are "center" or "left" or "right"
//whenever it is necessary we need to use this attribute
//You can attach attribute only in opening tag. Dont add in closing tag
example:
key="value" or 'value'
<p align="center">welcome to html</p>

Block And Inline (interview question)
//html tags are divided into two types 
1.block - 
-It will not allow other element in the same line
-It always start in new line
-It will occupy entire line
example:
<p></p>
<h1></h1>.....<h6></h6>
<div></div>
2.inline 
-it will allow other element in same line 
-It always continue in the same line but before tag is block means it will continue in next line 
-It will not occupy entire line 
<b></b> - Content will become bold
<i></i> - Content will become italic
<span></span>
===============================================
