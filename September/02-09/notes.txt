//It consists of four properties 
1.width*height 
2.padding

//border will surround around the width and height

h1{
    border:5px solid red; 
}
5px --> thickness of border 
solid --> to style border (solid,dotted,double)
red -->color of the border 
3.padding 
//It will adjust the content within the width and height 
//It will helps to move the position top,bottom,left,right 
//Whenever we give padding the width and height will get increase to avoid that we need to use box-sizing:border-box 
example:
box-sizing:border-box;
padding:60px;
4.margin 
//It will move the entire box from left to right or top to bottom 
//It will not overwrite other tags 
//All the tags will move their position
