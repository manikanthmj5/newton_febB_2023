Box Modal:
//Every tag in html will have box modal 
//It consists of four properties 
1.width*height 
2.padding 
3.border 
4.margin 
//To make alignment in the page. It play very important role.
CSS Unit:
1px - 1inch
1.width * height 
//Each tag we can provide width and height in px 
//It is not mandatory to provide width and height for all tags 
//Whenever is needed we can apply either width or height or both 
example:
h1{
    width:200px;
    height:100px;
}
2.border 
//Surrounding place of tags with can apply border 
//border will surround around the width and height 
//It consists of three values 
example:
h1{
    border:5px solid red; 
}
5px --> thickness of border 
solid --> to style border (solid,dotted,double)
red -->color of the border 
3.padding 
//It will adjust the content within the width and height 
//It will helps to move the position top,bottom,left,right 
//Whenever we give padding the width and height will get increase to avoid that we need to use box-sizing:border-box 
example:
box-sizing:border-box;
padding:60px;
