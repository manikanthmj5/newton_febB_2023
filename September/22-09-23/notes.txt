Sync and Async 
//Javascript function can be written in two ways.
1.sync function -- It will executed immediately
2.async function -- it will take sometime to execute the code
example:
1.setTimeout
2.setInterval
3.callback
4.promise
5.async await 


setTimeout:
//It is inbuilt function available inside the javascript.
//It is async code.
//After completing all sync code then only async code will execute.
1000millisecond = 1second
example:
setTimeout(function(){
